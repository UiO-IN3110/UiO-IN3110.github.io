    "# Regex\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex is a *language describing patterns of text.* \n",
    "\n",
    "A regex typically consists of a search pattern, which is used by string-searching algorithms to \"find\" or \"find and replace\" sequences in a string.\n",
    " \n",
    "Regex is introduced in more detail by Simon in the video lectures\n",
    "1. [Regex 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma93hpNFXZM)\n",
    "2. [Regex 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6XoKtQA2Fc)\n",

    "\n",
    "Regex is difficult to learn, however, by just watching videos. **It is one of those things you learn by doing!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the live lecture, we will practice regex together. \n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to skim the video lectures, then practice basic regex, and finally rewatch the lecture videos.\n",

    "## Basic regex syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex is used across most programming languages. In this lecture, we will be working with regex in [https://regex101.com/](regex101) and python. First, let us learn basic regex syntax by playing around in regex101.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Character classes**\n",
    "- `\\d` : matches a single character that is a digit\n",
    "- `\\w` : matches a word character\n",
    "- `\\s` : matches a whitespace character\n",
    "- `.`  : matches any character\n",
    "\n",
    "Negations: `\\D`, `\\W`, `\\S` are the *negations* of `\\d`, `\\w` and `\\s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Anchors: `^`, `\\$` and `\\b`**\n",
    "- `^Hat` matches any string that starts with \"Hat\".\n",
    "- `Pay\\$` matches any string that ends with \"Pay\"\n",
    "- `\\b` matches a word boundary\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it out! Go to [regex 101](regex101.com) and play around in the field where it says \"insert your regular expression here\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](regex101.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions: \n",
    "- How do you match the \"4\"?\n",
    "- How do you match everything except the \"4\"?\n",
    "- How do you match the *first* \"hat\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Special characters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Special characters are reserved as keywords. They are:\n",
    "   `^`   `[`  `.` `$`     `{`    `*`   `(`  `\\`  `+`    `)`   `|`   `?` \n",
    "\n",
    "Literal versions of these characters have to be *escaped* by adding a \\\\ (backslash) in front of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, ^ is escaped by writing \\\\^.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question:\n",
    "- In our regex101 example, can you match the $?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Flags**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, try matching \"store.\\$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "From the material we have covered so far, you would not expect any matches... Yet we get two!\n",
    "![alt text](regex101-store.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That is because regex101 is using the multiline flag, where ^ and \\$ are used to match the begin and end of each line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question:\n",
    "- Can you turn off multi line? (Tip: Hover your mouse over \"mg\")\n",
    "- What happens when you match \"store.\" with the multi line flag on and the global flag off?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Quantifiers**\n",
    "\n",
    "The characters `*`, `+`, `?` and `{}` are reserved as quantifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "- `abc*` matches a string that has ab followed by zero or more c.\n",
    "- `abc+` matches a string that has ab followed by one or more c\n",
    "- `abc?` matches a string that has ab followed by zero or one c\n",
    "- `abc{2}` matches a string that has ab followed by 2 c\n",
    "- `abc{2,}` matches a string that has ab followed by 2 or more c\n",
    "- `abc{2, 5}` matches a string that has ab followed by 2 to 5 c\n",
    "\n",
    "Question:\n",
    "- How many regexes can you make that matches \"ccc\" in \"abccc\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Greedy and lazy operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantifiers `*`, `+`, `?` and `{}` are all *greedy*, meaning they will match with the longest string they can find. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make them *lazy*, we add a question mark: `*?`, `+?`, `??` and `{}?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Question:\n",
    "- Take as your test string: `Norwegian: \"God dag\". Italian: \"Buongiorno\"`\n",
    "Can you match the greetings?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**OR operator - `|` or `[]`**\n",
    "- `a(b|c)` matches a string that has a followed by b or c\n",
    "- `a[bc] ` matches a string that has a followed by bor c \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `gr[ae]y` matches gray and grey.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grouping and capturing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Placing parts of the regex inside `()` will group that part of the regex together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `a(bc)+` matches strings that have a followed by one or more bc\n",
    "\n",
    "The paranthesis also *captures* the corresponding match and allows us to *backreference* it using `\\1`, `\\2` etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `a(bc)\\1` will match abcbc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: \n",
    "- Can you make a regex that matches any character repeated twice?\n",
    "For example, your regex should match \"ee\" in \"Rita Skeeter\".\n",
    "- Can you make a regex that matches any repeated character?\n",
    "For example, your regex should match \"sss\" in \"headmistressship\".\n",
    "- Bonus: If you work on a text for a long time, you eventually become completely blind to your own mistakes. For example, my master thesis contains double \"the the\" 3 times. Can you make a regex that finds repeated words?\n",
    "\n",
    "That concludes basic regex syntax! Now onto python and regex. \n"
